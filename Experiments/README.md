## Exp_1 FGSM - Saliency
Experiment to show the SmoothGrad Saliency Map result of general FGSM attack

## Exp_2 TGSM - Saliency
Expermient to show the SmoothGrad Saliency Map result of general TGSM attack. Two ideas from the experiment that can be further continued to be explored. 
##### First 
We can use TGSM to skew the important pixels of the model from looking at the whole picture to specific areas. Is there a simple way to defend against that?
##### Second
By using TGSM to make the picture more confident in the "correct" class, we see the model looking at a more spread out picture. Can we use this technique to do something?
