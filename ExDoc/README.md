## SmoothGrad
Technique that adds noise when generating the Saliency Map of an object. This ultimately returns a sharper, more concentrated Saliency Map of where the model is focusing on.

## Improving Adversarial Robustness
Paper that shows some techniques on explaining and defending against different adversarial attacks. This has some useful baseline techniques to use for the project when looking for new ways to defend against adversarial attacks.

## Adversarial Attacks
Original Paper that demonstrates the basic attacks used in this projects. FGSM and TGSM
